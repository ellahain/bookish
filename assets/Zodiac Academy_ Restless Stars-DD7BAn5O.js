I was kind of skeptical after reading book 8 and I was so pissed off with Tory that I genuinely considered not reading this one but I'm glad I did because I could not put this down!! Starting off with BlueLance!!!!!!!! (Yes, they require that many exclamation points because I love them so much). They were probably the only reason I kept reading because I ate up every crumb of them. SethCaleb - they FINALLY got their stuff together and communicated and it was amazing truly. their children at the end were adorable. ToryDarius - *sigh* you know. i didn't hate them. i didn't love them. the amount of times i had to read about Darius' "seed" though has to be a crime. Like my god we get it you're horny. but all's well that ended well i guess. i feel like they kind of got off light in terms of punishment for literally bringing him back from the dead (???) but whatever. again i say all's well that end's well. MaxGeraldine - AUGUSTALINE. that's all i have to say all in all a really great save after book 8 and i need a book about Tharix and then all of the main mc's children down the line`})})]})]})}export{r as default};
