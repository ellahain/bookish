Being a dairy farm, they mostly raise their cows for milk. I also think it’s interesting because my cousins will actually show their calves at fairs (kind of like showing dogs, but with cows). They get all dressed up and walk their cows around and it's a big thing in their town. I was reflecting on this practice as I was reading about how some cows are treated so poorly and are forced to essentially just stand still until the farmers are ready to milk them and although I’m not really involved with their farm or their showings, I think it’s nice that they show them off and form close relationships with them through this event. It made me happy to know that cows appreciate it when we recognize them, so I hope that the cows on my cousin’s farm are happier than some of those who are stuck in crowded farms. Something else that really resonated with me was when they talked about how farms are being hurt by the economy, especially local, family farms. My family has definitely noticed how difficult it is to keep their farm running, which I think is something people need to be more aware of because not many people think about where their milk is coming from when they buy it in cartons at the grocery store. Since I know them, I know how much work goes into caring for the cows and producing milk, so if these kinds of family farms are forced out of business, soon all that will be left are the factory farms that greatly mistreat their cows."})})]})]})}export{h as default};
